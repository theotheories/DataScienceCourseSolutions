Answer here\n","All of these answers pivot on the proportion of our dataset which is labelled!\n","* 4.1  Supervised: Because most of the dataset has transactions labelled, I would suggest using a fully labelled subset of our dataset to train a fully supervised ML model. This probably gives better fitting to unseen values. It wouldn't be as expensive to add more labelled data since we already have so much of it too. \n","* 4.2 Semi-supervised: A small portion of the dataset being labelled makes this problem a good candidate for semi-supervised ML, because it is cheaper to make assumptions and extrapolate a function from the few labels we have, which can propagate these labels to similar data points  in the rest of the dataset, than it would be to pay humans for their time to label the rest of the dataset manually. We can extrapolate to \"fill in the blanks\" so to speak. We will be able to predict a continuous \"customer satisfaction value\" despite missing labels/data.\n","* 4.3 Supervised: Majority of the emails are labelled, so I would suggest making a supervised dataset. Train the ML model function only on labelled data, then use that function to label the unlabelled emails accordingly. Cheaper than paying human reviewers.\n","* 4.4 Supervised: we have vast data for this, and we know exactly which historical customers defaulted, and we have those historical customers' complete data, so we can fully train a supervised ML model to predict the future probability of unseen future credit card applicants.
